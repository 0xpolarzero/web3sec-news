To install Deno and run your TypeScript file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Install Deno by running the following command:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the package manager `brew` (for macOS/Linux) or `chocolatey` (for Windows) if you have them installed:

   For macOS/Linux:
   ```
   brew install deno
   ```

   For Windows (with chocolatey):
   ```
   choco install deno
   ```

3. Once Deno is installed, check that it's working correctly by running:
   ```
   deno --version
   ```

   You should see the version number if Deno was installed successfully.

4. To run your TypeScript file, use the `deno run` command followed by the file path:
   ```
   deno run -A ./src/to-markdown.ts
   Example usage: to-markdown {url}

   ```
