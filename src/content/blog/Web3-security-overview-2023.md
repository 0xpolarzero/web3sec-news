## Why is there a need for smart contract security?

- Security is essential since blockchain is a distributed, decentralized system that depends on immutability and trust to function. Because blockchain technology is built on the principles of security and trust, any security lapse might have disastrous consequences.
- Blockchain chain technology enables smart contracts, which automate contract execution and fulfillment. More than $12.3 billion in financial losses have been caused by smart contract flaws so far in the Web3 industry.

## ****What are smart contract vulnerabilities?****

- Yearn Finance was hacked in April 2023 as a result of a bug in its smart contracts. The attacker altered the value of the yUSDT tokens by taking advantage of the improper placement of a Fulcrum USDC contract address in place of USDT, cheating the protocol out of about $10 million.
- In conclusion, reentrancy attack-style exploits are examples of smart contract vulnerabilities—code flaws that attackers might take advantage of. Through this approach, bad contracts can steal money or change the state of a weak contract. For instance, significant financial losses may result if a decentralized exchange (DEX) contract incorrectly updates user token balances.

## Review of Smart contract hacks and Vulnerabilities in 2023

> Smart contracts offer immutability, which prevents changes after distribution, but they are difficult to patch for known faults or vulnerabilities. 
> It is also important to deploy proactive measures to keep track of malicious transactions and attacks residing on the chain.

- As a result, there have been more than 330 attacks so far this year, costing more than $600 million.
- According to further examination, 148+ projects on BNB networks, 75+ projects on the Ethereum chain, 18 hacks on the Polygon chain, and 80+ hacks on Abritrum, Solana, ZKSync, Algorand, etc. were all compromised.
- It is terrible to see how exit scams and social media account takeover operations have contributed significantly to more than 200 hacking cases. These hostile actions have hurt the reputation of countless projects and caused financial losses by taking advantage of security flaws and careless users.
- 64 vulnerabilities in smart contracts, 29 flash loan attacks, 15 price/oracle manipulations, and other vulnerabilities were exploited out of the remaining 130 projects that were compromised.
- While we comprehend the attacks and the blockchain that was compromised, it's crucial to know that 140+ protocol tokens, 83 NFT protocols, 66+ DeFi protocols, 12 DEX, 7 DAO, and 11 bridges, wallets, CeFi, etc. protocols were also compromised.
- As a result, it draws attention to the necessity for more security precautions and user education to reduce these dangers in the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.
