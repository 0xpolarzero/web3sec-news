## GAS OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

### 1. Don't initialize variables

Initializing variables in Solidity can consume unnecessary gas if the variables are subsequently assigned new values before being accessed. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary variable initialization can help save gas in certain scenarios.

> use uint256 flag; instead of uin256 flag=0;

### 2. Use External instead of Public when you only need to call functions from outside of contracts

```solidity
gas-used 24612
function PublicFunction() public returns (uint256) {
    return 5;
}

gas-used 24586
function ExternalFunction() external returns (uint256) {
    return 5;
}
```

### 3. Use Mappings Instead of Arrays

**lets compare two contracts for this statement**

- Contract 1 --> Array.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ArrayExample {
    uint256[] public dataArray;

    function addData(uint256 data) public {
        dataArray.push(data);
    }
}
```

- Contract 2 --> Mapping.sol

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MappingExample {
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public dataMapping;

    function addData(uint256 key, uint256 data) public {
        dataMapping[key] = data;
    }
}

```

> In Mapping.sol contract total gas used is `53459` while in Array.sol total gas used is `80683`

### 4. Always use solidity optimizer

> The Solidity optimizer is a feature that optimizes the bytecode generated by the Solidity compiler, resulting in reduced gas consumption and potentially smaller contract sizes.

### 5. Use indexed events

**Using indexed events can indeed help save gas when working with events in Solidity. By carefully selecting and indexing the relevant parameters in an event, you can optimize gas usage and improve the efficiency of event filtering.**

- Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GasSavingsExample {
    event NewTransaction(
        address indexed sender,
        address indexed recipient,
        uint256 amount
    );

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        emit NewTransaction(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
}

```
